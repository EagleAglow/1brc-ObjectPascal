# Brian Fire

An Entry to the One Billion Row Challenge in Object Pascal using Delphi 12 by [EagleAglow](https://github.com/EagleAglow), Discord: briar.on.fire

## Compiler

**Delphi 12** Professional Edition

### Dependencies

Project uses Delphi units: `Classes`, `System.SysUtils`, `System.StrUtils` and `Math`.

### UTF8 vs. Windows Terminal

The text in the Windows Terminal console uses the system code page, which does not play well with `UTF8`.
The only way to match the approved result is to write the output to a file, with resulting `SHA256` hash:\
`db3d79d31b50daa8c03a1e4f2025029cb137f9971aa04129d8bca004795ae524`

If the Windows console output is redirected to a file, some characters are mangled, and the resulting `SHA256` hash is:\
`82411ba76c59ae765e85b497f135a8f4e68d7a14cb7c0909ba96dea0d0635a28`

For the challenge, compiled for LINUX, the console result will (hopefully) be correct.

### Execution
```
    Usage
    bfire -h                       |  Write this help message and exit
    bfire -v                       |  Write the version and exit
    bfire -i <file_1>              |  <file_1> contains Weather Data
    bfire -i <file_1> -o <file_2>  |  <file_1> contains Weather Data
                                   |  <file_2> contains result
    If <file_2> is not defined, result goes to CONSOLE (STDOUT)
```

#### Contest Mode

To run the challenge, read from the 'challenge.csv' file:

```console
C:> bfire -i challenge.csv
```

## Remarks

I haven't used Delphi very much recently, really needed to work on this for a refresher.
I like TStringList self-sorting, but it is not as fast as other techniques.
Now that this entry is set up, I can play with improvements. Maybe even get a time under 15 minutes! :)

## History

- Version 1.0: first working version.
